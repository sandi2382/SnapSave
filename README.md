"They’ll view it, laugh, and then the Snap disappears from the screen – unless they take a screenshot!"...or do 'they'? 

SnapSave allows savvy users to replicate a request when loading a snap.
Route traffic from your device through a proxy, open snapchat, 'tap to load' the snap of interest and seek how to replicate.  
* Two Scripts, Two Libraries! (sorta)
 * Pick your poison with either the urllib module or the request library  
* Requires network sniffing to obtain necessary values of fields in the POST form used in viewing a snap  
* Adds required headers to return the snap binary blob in jpg form  

Future updates will allow more flexiblity in prompts of version, hardware and locale as well as allow for story downloads amongst other things.
